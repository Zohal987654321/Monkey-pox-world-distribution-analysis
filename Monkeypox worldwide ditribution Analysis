# GLOBAL MONKEYPOX DATA
# 
# INTRODUCTION:
# 
# The data to be analysed in this notebook is real global data which contains details of all the reported Monkeypox cases, dated  from May, 2022 till 18 September, 2022. Though Monkeypox cases have been detected since 1971 in Central Africa, during the time of collection of this data, there has been a major outbreak of this illness all over the world. It has turned into a global pandemic and,  hence it is an important data to be analysed so as to help understand and form  inform choices and policies to better manage this situation in favour of human race.
# 
# SOURCE:This data has been downloaded from kaggle website.The link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/global-monkeypox-cases. Since this data is downloaded from the source a few weeks ago, the owner of the link has modified the data and removed alot of values in columns. The modified data doesnot fulfill the criteria for this project of minimum 10 columns. So, I will be analysing based on the original data that I had downloaded with 36 columns and 69,639 rows.This data is in csv format and has string,Bool, Date,float  and int type of data. 
#    During my analysis of this data, I noticed that Democratic Republic of Congo has disproportionately high Mortality rate with respect to confirmed and suspected cases of Monkeypox in this region, compared to other countries of the world such as United States.From this  data, I found that  United States has the highest number of reported cases of Monkeypox worldwide during this pandemic, but managed to have much lower Monkeypox-related mortality rate. This needs to be analysed. There can be a variety of reasons for it, one is the socioeconomic difference between the countries and another can be genomic distribution of the Monkeypox virus. In this notebook, I will see if there is any correlation in the data  between Monkeypox-related deaths  and poverty rates among countries affected by Monkeypox. For this I downloaded WorldBank sourced data linked here:https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/poverty-rate-by-country.This data is in csv format and has 5 columns and 173 rows.
# 
# Methods: In this notebook, I have extensively used Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,plotly . I have used Pandas and csv libraries to import and read files.Pandas is used extensively along with its functions to work with DataFrames .Numpy functions have been used in many places. Visualisations are made using Matplotlib, seaborn and plotly libraries.
# Procedure: I will first import the Monkepox data  and print information about the data.

# From the above Bar plot of 'Countries with Highest incidence of confirmed cases of Monkeypox outbreak in 2022', 
# we can conclude that United States has highest number of confirmed cases followed by Brazil that has less than half confirmed cases in United States. We can see that the illness is widely spread among countries of many continents.

#      In the next plot, we will plot 'Countries with highest incidence of confirmed/suspected cases of Monkeypox', which will help us know if the suspected cases are higher than confirmed cases in any country. This information is important in deciding to see if there is a need to make diagnosing and testing facilities available.

# Comparing the above two graphs, we can clearly see that Democratic Republic of Congo is in number 7 in  combined confirmed and suspected cases as in graph' Countries with highest incidence of confirmed/suspected cases of Monkeypox in 2022', while the confirmed cases are comparatively so low that it does not even appear in top 20 in the graph of 'Incidence of confirmed cases only'.US  very high overall number of cases compared to all countries of the world.Other countries have same position in both highest incidence of confirmed cases and overall cases. Democratic Republic Of The Congo is the only country that shift positions immensely when plotted for overall cases compared to confirmed cases. This can reveal that Monkeyvirus test confirmation is not very effective in the country , which can be further investigated.
#   Next, we will gather information about most common symptoms of Monkeypox illness and plot a graph .

# In the above graph, we can see that most common symptom of Monkeypox is 'genital ulcer lesions'.Genital ulcer, oral ulcers, rashes and fever can be regarded as common symptoms of Monkeypox.

The graph 'Gender proportion of cases of MonkeyPox in 2022' clealry shows that although women have been affected rarely, its highly 
  common among men. This is an important character and can lead us to investigate what makes this communicable virus  more common 
  in  men, while it has affected females somtimes too.
     Now, we will see how fatal this illness is.

# In the graph of 'Countries associated  with highest rate of Death from Monkeypox', we can see that Democratic Republic of The Congo' sits on top with 54 person dead from Monkeypox out of 83 worldwide. We can see that other African Countries are next in number of deaths.Also, though US have very high number of cases of Monkeypox, but fortunately Mortality from Monkeypox is quite low there. 
#   The high Mortality from Monkeypox in African countries, especially Democratic Republic of The Congo is very obvious in the graph. This invites further research to find the reason of this disproportion. I will investigate  if poverty in countries are related to number of deaths from Monkeypox. To do this, I will import and read a csv file that shows rate of poverty in different countries . This data is sourced from World Bank data on global economy.The link to this data is https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/poverty-rate-by-country.
